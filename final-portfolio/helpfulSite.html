          <h2>Asian American History through Art</h2>

        <div class="description">
        	<p>A website to educate people on the history of Asian Americans between 1850 and the present day through the lens of art. In comparison to writers and political activists, the presence of artists has been marginal in the discussion of ethnic and racial minorities. The goal of this website is to not only educate others on Asian-American history in the U.S., but also to support and highlight Asian/Asian American artists and their work. </p>
