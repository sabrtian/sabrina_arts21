  	<h1>The Color of Nature: A Conversation with Victo Ngai</h1>

  	<div class="question-container-1">
        <div><span>Arley Sorg:</span> Are there themes or motifs that you enjoy that appear in your work often, and what do you like most about them?</div>
        
        <hr>  

        <div><span class="second-speaker">Victo Ngai:</span> Oh, interesting. I think I really enjoy pulling elements from nature, because, it’s just so great. I feel like if you look at the past artists, the really great ones, they also do the same. I recently went to Spain and I had a little bit more time this time, so I had an in-depth tour of Gaudí’s architecture. And then I went to the backroom exhibition—we really actually went through everything!</div>
	</div>

	<div class="question-container-2">

        <div><span class="person-2">Arley Sorg:</span> 

        	<p class="indented">I saw in the body of work presented on your website that you have some key pieces that are very “modern.” For example, there’s the drawing of the car—do you feel like you’re able to bring that natural element into those pieces as well?</p>
        </div>

        <div><span class="person-2">Victo Ngai:</span>

        	<p class="indented">I think so, in some ways. Even though my line art is quite precise, I feel like I really enjoy the fluidity and curves. I don’t really have anything that’s straight, right angle, or very vectorized. Even when I do architecture drawings, I like it still a little bit off, a little quirky. I just really like the warmth—and I feel like that’s also something that’s separate, maybe, that nature vs. man-made. To quote Gaudí “The straight line belongs to men, the curved one to God.” Personally, I am really drawn to the tactility and warmth of the organic feeling.</p>

    <div class="question-container-3">
    	<div id="boxed1">
  			<span>Arley Sorg:</span> Your work has a lot of different moods and expressions, but I feel like you gravitate toward reds, golds, and greens. What is it about these combinations of colors that speak to you? </div>

  			<br>

		<div id="boxed2">
  			<span>Victo Ngai:</span> I feel like those are my comfort colors, kind of like your comfort food. I love traveling, I love all kinds of cuisines, but when I’m really tired, I always gravitate toward Chinese food because of my upbringing. And I feel like that’s the same with my palette. That is quite an Asian-esque palette, I would say, and probably the earliest one that I got familiarized with, and probably the one I had the most experience with. I always feel like color choices and how we approach our lines—all this simple stuff added together—is what contributes to an artist’s style. And a so-called style essentially is built on this baseline of who you are, which was influenced by your surroundings as a kid.</div>

			<p class="centered">That makes sense. When I think of Chinese art and those colors, I feel like a lot of times it’s very stark, very bright, and the way that you use them gives your pieces a warmth and softness.</p>
		</div>

		<br>

        <div><span class="person-4">Victo Ngai</span> 

        	<p class="centered">That’s a really interesting and good observation. I feel like it depends on what kind of Chinese art you’re looking at. If you’re looking at scroll paintings of landscape, they’re quiet monochromatic, very, very few colors, and beautifully designed mark makings. I feel like my line art is probably more influenced by that kind of artwork and gongbi hua. But color-wise, it’s mostly from folk art and crafts, from textiles for example, from interior design and architecture. Those things tend to have quite brilliant colors and really nice complementary colors. When you translate those elements into a two-dimensional art piece, there’s some transition that needs to be made.</p>

			<p class="padding">You do a lot of different pieces for a lot of different types of clients, but your art is appreciated by (and quite fitting for) the SF/F community. You also do commercial, such as American Express, shoe campaigns. Where does science fiction and fantasy fit into your creativity or your artistic body of work?</p>
		</div>

        <div  class="row"><span class="person-5">Victo Ngai</span> 

        	<br>

        	<p class="padding">Well, first of all, I think “genre” is pretty overrated. Not just scifi/fantasy within illustration, but also, why separate illustration with fine art? I feel like that development is very, very recent, and mostly for the market rather than the art itself. Most people would say Michelangelo is fine art, but if you look at the purpose of his art, it’s pretty much illustration for the Bible, but done on the mural. Now that’s three separate categories these days! I mean, what is illustration, essentially? It’s telling story with visuals. And I feel like a lot of us do that in different ways. Of course, certain art, like the modern art movement, such as abstract expressionism or minimalism, got rid of that storytelling aspect. But even so, pair a Jackson Pollock painting with some well-chosen words, meaning and stories can still emerge and be ran as an editorial illustration or ad campaign. So how do we really define what’s what, is it by its style, media or function?</p>
