				<li> California becomes the first state to issue a mandatory stay-at-home order, mandating all California residents to quarantine
				other than those who work essential jobs or to shop for essential needs. </li>

				<li> Mathematical models based on Wuhan, China, show that social distancing and stricted stay-at-home orders prove effective in 
				flattening the COVID-19 curve. </li>
			</ul>

				<li> 加州成为第一个发布强制居家令的州，强制所有加州居民接受隔离除了从事基本工作或为基本需求购物的人。</li>

				<li> 基于中国武汉的数学模型显示，事实证明，社会距离和严格的家庭订单可以有效地拉平新冠肺炎曲线。 </li>

				As these stay at home orders begin, almost 100 reports of attacks, violence, and hate speech against Asian Americans in the Bay Area are reported to Stop AAPI Hate, an organization started by the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University, launched in response to escalation in xenophobia and bigotry towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in California due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

				Reports found that more acts of discrimination are performed inside businesses, rather than in public spaces, due to the stay-at-home order. These include: 

				<ul class="chinese-american">
					<li> “I was shouted at and harassed by the cashier, workers, as well as customers at the store to get out of the store. ‘You Chinese bring the virus here and you dare asking people to keep social distance guideline.’” </li>

					<li> "Walking to work, older black man walking towards my direction yelled fucking chinese disease and suddenly stepped near me and spat at me hitting my coat, scarf and face. A lot of disgusting saliva. Cop nearby when I told him he said I could go after the aggressor who was still in plain sight. Younger black man who saw everything backed me up. Cop was useless." </li>

					<li> "Young “white” girl told her parents she was going to “Die” (repeatedly) and her parents asked why? And she said of Coronavirus and pointed in my direction." </li>

					<li> "In a workplace team meeting, I found myself being a target of snarky remarks about being linked to the source and the spread of the coronavirus. I'm not Chinese and I haven't traveled internationally in years. It was ignorance at its best and comments were taken as good humor by others in the room." </li>
				</ul>
 			</p> 

 			<p class="chinese-american"> The full report can be read below. </p>

				随着这些留在家里的命令开始，近100份关于海湾地区针对亚裔美国人的攻击、暴力和仇恨言论的报告被报告给了“阻止AAPI仇恨”，这是一个由亚太规划和政策委员会、中国平权行动组织和旧金山州立大学亚裔美国人研究系发起的组织，旨在应对由于新冠肺炎大流行而在加州对亚裔美国人和太平洋岛民的仇外心理和偏见的升级。

				报告发现，由于居家命令，更多的歧视行为发生在企业内部，而不是公共场所。其中包括:

				<ul class="chinese-american">
					<li> “我被收银员、工人以及商店的顾客喊着骚扰着走出商店。“你们中国人把病毒带到这里，还敢要求人们保持社交距离。”” </li>

					<li> "走路去上班，老黑人朝我的方向走来，大喊他妈的中国病，突然走近我，朝我吐口水，打我的外套，围巾和脸。好多恶心的口水。当我告诉警察时，他就在旁边，他说我可以去追那个还在视线范围内的侵略者。目睹一切的年轻黑人支持我。警察没用。" </li>

					<li> "年轻的“白人”女孩告诉父母她要“死”(反复)父母问为什么？她谈到冠状病毒，并指向我的方向。" </li>

					<li> "在一次工作场所的团队会议上，我发现自己成为了尖刻评论的目标，这些评论说自己与冠状病毒的来源和传播有关。我不是中国人，几年没出过国了。这是最大的无知，房间里的其他人把这些评论当成了幽默。" </li>
				</ul>
