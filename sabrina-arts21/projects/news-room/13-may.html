			<p class="chinese-american"> This worry is enhanced as reports of verbal attacks, physical assault, and more have drastically increased to almost 2,000 since March. Some of these reports include:  </p>

			<ul class="chinese-american">
 				<li>
 					“Was called “Chinese Coronavirus” while being in line at [fast food] drive through. The young man spit and pretended to cough. Was with my sister, an RN who was getting a heath hero meal, and my 6-year old son.“
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“A Caucasian resident in the building I live in refused to allow me access to the elevator telling me, “NO, don’t you even think about getting on,” and blocked my access with his body. This same resident allowed other Caucasian residents on the elevator. “
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“My 70-year old mother was shopping alone and while waiting in line at a grocery store (where she has shopped for 11+ years), she was at least 6 feet from the customer in front of her (plus with a cart between them). The Caucasian female customer, in her 40's, was chatting with her husband, when she suddenly saw my mom, she immediately yelled "Back up!!! Back up more!!! Back up!!! Do me you understand me?!!!" in an aggressive, loud, condescending manner, multiple times until my mother was about 15 feet away. “
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“A young black man in his 20’s approached me from the other end of the sidewalk, came right up to my face, said in an angry voice “They told me to hit you” and then punched me in the side of the head. “
 				</li>
 			</ul>

 			<p class="chinese-american"> 自3月份以来，关于言语攻击、人身攻击等的报道急剧增加到近2000起，这种担忧加剧了。其中一些报告包括: </p> 

 			<ul class="chinese-american">
 				<li>
 					“在快餐店排队时被称为“中国冠状病毒”。年轻人吐口水，假装咳嗽。我和我的姐姐，一个正在吃健康英雄餐的注册护士，还有我6岁的儿子在一起。”“
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“我住的楼里的一个白人居民拒绝让我进入电梯，告诉我，“不，你想都别想上车，”并用他的身体挡住了我的通道。这位居民允许其他高加索居民上电梯。”
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“我70岁的母亲独自购物，在一家杂货店排队时(她在那里购物已经11年多了)，她离面前的顾客至少6英尺(外加他们之间有一辆手推车)。这位白人女性顾客，40多岁，正在和丈夫聊天，突然看到我妈，马上大喊“退后！！！多备份！！！退后。！！你明白我吗？！！!"以一种挑衅的、大声的、居高临下的方式，多次，直到我的母亲离我大约15英尺远。 “
 				</li>

 				<li>
 					“一个20多岁的年轻黑人从人行道的另一端走近我，径直走到我面前，用愤怒的声音说“他们让我打你”，然后打了我的头。“
